This project focuses on restoring missing or damaged parts of an image using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Inspired by how humans visually fill in gaps, we built a deep learning model capable of reconstructing incomplete images in a realistic and natural-looking way.

Aim
To design and implement a CNN-based image inpainting model

To accurately reconstruct missing regions while preserving textures and edges
